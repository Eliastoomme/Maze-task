# Maze Navigation with Q-Learning

## Introduction

This repository contains an implementation of the Q-learning algorithm to solve the maze-like environment navigation problem. The task involves training an RL agent to efficiently reach a target point while dealing with the challenge of becoming disoriented upon colliding with obstacles.

## Problem Statement

In the original problem, the RL agent was struggling to adapt to the disoriented state introduced when the robot collided with obstacles. To address this challenge, I explored and implemented several solutions.

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Increase Steps per Episode

To allow the agent more exploration and learning time within each episode, I increased the number of steps per episode from the default value to 200. This change enables the agent to gather more experiences in each episode, which is particularly beneficial when dealing with a disoriented state.

### Solution 2: Decrease Epsilon

Reducing the initial exploration probability (epsilon) to 0.5 encourages the agent to prioritize exploitation over exploration from the beginning of training. Lowering epsilon allows the agent to exploit its current knowledge to a greater extent, potentially leading to more efficient learning.

### Solution 3: Decrease Epsilon Decay

The epsilon decay rate influences how quickly the agent shifts from exploration to exploitation. To make the transition more gradual and allow the agent to explore more extensively, I decreased the epsilon decay rate to 0.8. This means that epsilon will decrease more quickly over time, giving the agent more opportunities for exploitation.


## Conclusion

In implementing these solutions, I have taken significant steps towards improving the performance of the Q-learning agent in navigating the maze-like environment with a disoriented state. However, it's important to note that the nature of the problem introduces a stochastic element.

The challenge of navigating an environment with random choices, particularly during the disoriented state, means that there may not be a one-size-fits-all solution. While these strategies enhance the agent's ability to adapt and learn, there is no guarantee that they will always solve the problem optimally.

To achieve the best results in such a stochastic environment, it may be necessary to experiment with various hyperparameter settings, alternative exploration strategies, or more advanced reinforcement learning algorithms. Continuous monitoring and iterative refinement of the agent's behavior are crucial for success in complex and unpredictable scenarios.
